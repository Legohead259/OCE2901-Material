\chapter*{Literature Review Quad Chart}

\section*{Overview}
\textbf{\emph{GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY!}} For this assignment, you will search the literature of technical and refereed journals to find a paper on surfing physics, surfability, surf technology, or other related topic.
Prepare a quad chart that summarizes the article and explains it main topic and contribution(s) to the field. 

You may use the example below \underline{\textbf{\emph{as a reference}}}

\emph{Hint:} Do the background research ahead of the research topic proposal and use the articles you find for this review!

\section*{Requirements}
The chart must conform to the following format:

\vspace{0.5cm}

{
\setlength\extrarowheight{4pt}
\begin{table}[h!]
	\label{tab:quad_chart format}
	\begin{tabular}{| p{0.3\linewidth} | p{0.3\linewidth} |}
		\hline
		\textbf{Introduction} \newline Paper title, author(s) name, your name, executive summary. & 
		\textbf{Explanation of Main Topic} \newline Describe the main topic of the paper in detail. Use pictures or figures from the article to assist. \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Relevancy to Class} \newline How is this paper relevant to the class and (preferably) to your research topic? &
		\textbf{Contributions to Society} \newline What was the background motivation for the paper? Did they provide anything useful? What, in your opinion, is the most valuable take-away? \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
}

\section*{Grading}
This assignment will use a pass-fail scheme.
Your quad chart must adequately summarize the article and give enough detail that the instructor can understand the gist.
If you fail to do so, or do not submit a quad chart, your grade will be a 0 with the option of a redo for half-credit.
