\chapter*{Homework 2: Research Topic Quad Chart}

\section*{Overview}
For this assignment, you team will create a quad chart explaining your proposed research topic that you will explore during the semester.
Be sure to come up with a unique topic that is exciting and can sustain your group for the entire semester!

It is okay if your team does not come up with a research topic.
In that event, you will be asked to research the relationship between a surfer's motion and the wave characteristics using three unique non-dimensional parameters.

You may use the example below \underline{\textbf{\emph{as a reference}}}

\section*{Requirements}
The chart must conform to the following format:

\vspace{0.5cm}

{
\setlength\extrarowheight{4pt}
\begin{table}[h!]
	\label{tab:quad_chart format}
	\begin{tabular}{| p{0.3\linewidth} | p{0.3\linewidth} |}
		\hline
		\textbf{Introduction} \newline Introduce your team members and team name. Describe your topic and goals. & 
		\textbf{Required Sensors and Measured Variables} \newline Describe what sensors you think you would need and what data you would use from them. \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Motivations} \newline Describe your team's motivation for choosing this research topic &
		\textbf{Contributions to Society} \newline Describe how exploring the research question benefits society \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
}

\section*{Grading}
This assignment will use a pass-forgive scheme.
You must convince the instructor that your research topic is worthy using this quad chart.
If you fail to do so, or do not submit a quad chart, the grade will be forgiven and your team will be tasked with researching the default prompt.
